Goal

* Pixel art editor
* Keep code simple so it's easy to render the editor
* See if we can avoid using the canvas as the editing surface
* Little markup
* Export to png

I do frontend "differently"

* I don't use react, or vue.js
* Since most of my "webapps" are small, I keep HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the same file
